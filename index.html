			After seven years, three states, a townhome, two apartments, one condo, our own house, two cats, and a dog we have finally
			decided it's the right time to tie the knot. We would both like to invite you to save our date in preparation to help us
			finally celebrate the legal joining of our lives to each other in as traditional a fashion as we could muster.

			When it came time to think about our honeymoon we knew we wanted to take a trip to Europe. Both of us have traveled outside of the United States but as much as we have traveled we have never been out of the states together. We also felt we should travel somewhere neither of us have been so we could experience the country for the first time together. We combined Beth's love for the arts and wine with Bryan's interests in the ancient ruins and the fermentation process in general to make the decision to go to Italy. It is the birthplace of some of the greats: Michaelangelo, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, and more (but we'll skip those to avoid typos). We'll see where the gladiators fought, visit vineyards in Tuscany, and ride gondolas through the "streets" of Venice. We are looking forward to starting the next chapter of our life together... <span class="bold">marriage</span>... with an amazing trip to Italy!
